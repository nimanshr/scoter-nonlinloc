# Description of some of the above keywords and parameters:
#
## LOCSEARCH - search type
#   <initNumCells_x> <initNumCells_y> <initNumCells_z> (int)
#       Initial number of octtree cells in the x, y, and z directions.
#   <minNodeSize> (float)
#       Smallest octtree node side length to process. Tthe octree search
#       is terminated after a node with a side smaller than this length
#       is generated.
#   <maxNumNodes> (int)
#       Total number of nodes to process.
#   <numScatter> (int)
#       The number of scatter samples to draw from the octtree results.
#   <useStationsDensity> (int, >=0, default:0)
#       Flag, if >=1 weights oct-tree cell probability values used for
#       subdivide decision in proportion to number of stations in
#       oct-tree cell; gives higher search priority to cells containing
#       stations, stablises convergence to local events when global
#       search used with dense cluster of local stations (NOTE: different
#       results are obtained for different values that are >= 1).
#   <stopOnMinNodeSize> (int, min:0, max:1, default:1)
#       Flag, if 1 stops search when first minNodeSize reached, if 0 stop
#       subdividing a given cell when minNodeSize reached.
#
#
## LOCMETH - location method
#   <method> str
#       EDT_OT_WT = Weights EDT-sum probabilities by the variance of the
#       origin-time estimates over all pairs of readings. This reduces
#       the probability (PDF values) at points with inconsistent OT
#       estimates, and leads to more compact location PDFs.
#   <maxDistStaGrid> (float)
#       Maximum distance in km between a station and the center of the
#       initial search grid. Phases from stations beyond this distance
#       will not be used for event location. Use very large value for
#       no max.
#   <minNumberPhases> (int)
#       Minimum number of phases that must be accepted before event will
#       be located.
#   <maxNumberPhases> (int)
#       Maximum number of accepted phases that will be used for event
#       location. Only the first maxNumberPhases read from the phase or
#       observations file are used for location. Use -1 for no max.
#   <minNumberSphases> (int)
#       Minimum number of S phases that must be accepted before event
#       will be located. Use -1 for no min.
#   <VpVsRatio> (float)
#       Vp/Vs ratio. If >= 0.0 then only P phase travel-times grids are
#       read and the ratio is used to calculate S phase travel-times.
#       If < 0.0 then S phase travel-times grids are used.
#   <maxNum3DGridMemory> (int)
#       Maximum number of 3D travel-time grids to attempt to read into
#       memory for Metropolis-Gibbs search. If < 0 then NLLoc attempts
#       to read all grids into memory.
#   <minDistStaGrid> (float)
#       Minimum distance in km between a station and the center of the
#       initial search grid. Phases from stations closer than this
#       distance will not be used for event location. Use -1 for no max.
#   <duplicatePhase> (int, min:0, max:1)
#       Flag indicating if duplicate arrivals used for location
#       (1=reject, 0=use if time difference < sigma/2).
#       Duplicate arrivals have same station label and phase name.
#
#
## LOCELEVCORR - simple, vertical ray elevation correction
#   <flag> (int, min:0, max:1, default:0)
#       Flag to set activation of elevation correction (0=NO, 1=Yes).
#   <Vp> (float)
#       P velocity to use for calculation of the elevation correction
#       for P type phases (last leg of phase is P or p).
#   <Vs> (float)
#       S velocity to use for calculation of the elevation correction
#       for S type phases (last leg of phase is S or s).
#
#
## LOCSTAWT - station distribution weighting
#   <flag> (int, min:0, max:1, default:0)
#       Whether to apply station distribution weighting (0=NO, 1=YES).
#   <cutoffDist> (float)
#       Cutoff distance for weighting calculation. cutoffDist < 0.0 sets
#       automatic cutoff distance equal to the mean distance between all
#       pairs of stations used for location.
